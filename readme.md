# SockStream

This project is my continuing experimentation with streaming video data over web-sockets in binary format,
and reconstructing the video frame on the client side.

## TODO

- [ ] Break up the frames in smaller pieces.
- [ ] Reconstruct the smaller pieces on the client side when a complete frame is received.
